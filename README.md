# Streamliner

A sane RSS reader for the modern age.

## Planned features

- [ ] **Syndicated feeds**: Allow multiple feed URLs to be combined into a
  single feed, for example if they belong to a single creator.
- [ ] **Proper tag support**: Allow feeds to have multiple tags.
- [ ] **Views**: Allow the creation of views which filter feeds based on tags,
  keywords, date, read status, etc.
- [ ] **Inline viewer**: Allow rendering the contents of posts inside the
  application instead of just listing URLs.
